description: "Scaffold a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline — ingestion (load, chunk, embed, upsert) and retrieval (search, rerank, grounded prompt with citations) — fitted to the project's stack."

## Scope

Treat `$ARGUMENTS` as the data source(s) and the use case — e.g. "our markdown docs, for an in-app Q&A assistant" or "support tickets in Postgres, for answer suggestions". Restate it in one sentence to confirm before scaffolding.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask one focused question: *"What are you retrieving over, and what's the use case?"* Do not scaffold a generic pipeline against an imagined corpus.

> [!WARNING]
> Chunking quality dominates retrieval quality. A great embedding model and a great vector store cannot rescue chunks that split a sentence in half or merge three unrelated sections. Spend your attention on Step 3, not on picking a fancier model.

## Step 1 — Detect the stack and existing AI dependencies

Before writing anything, ground the scaffold in what's already here:

1. Identify the language/runtime — `Glob` for `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`, etc.
2. `Grep` for AI/RAG deps already in use: `openai`, `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `anthropic`, `langchain`, `llamaindex`, `@ai-sdk`, and any vector store client (`pinecone`, `weaviate`, `chromadb`, `qdrant`, `pgvector`, `@supabase`).
3. `Grep` for an existing embeddings/vector call so you extend the project's conventions instead of introducing a parallel one.

Match the scaffold to what you find. If the project already has a vector store or an LLM client, build on it rather than adding a competing dependency.

## Step 2 — Decide and state the key choices

Write these decisions at the top of the generated code as a comment block, so they're reviewable and tunable. Pick concrete defaults — don't punt to "configurable":

- **Chunking** — split on natural boundaries (headings, paragraphs, code blocks), not a blind character count. Default: ~400-800 tokens per chunk, 10-15% overlap. Attach metadata to every chunk: `source`, `title`, `heading`, and a line/char range for citation.
- **Embedding model** — use the project's existing provider if one is present; otherwise pick a current general-purpose embedding model and pin the dimension. State it explicitly so ingestion and retrieval can never drift apart.
- **Vector store** — reuse what's installed; if nothing exists, default to whatever the deployment already runs (e.g. `pgvector` if there's a Postgres, otherwise a local store). Store the chunk text alongside the vector and metadata.
- **Retrieval** — default top-k of 8-12 candidates, then an optional rerank pass down to the 3-5 chunks actually placed in the prompt.
- **Generation** — when a generation model is needed (answer synthesis, rerank-by-LLM), default to Anthropic's latest, most capable model: `claude-opus-4-8`.

> [!NOTE]
> Pin the embedding model and dimension in one shared constant imported by both halves. If ingestion embeds with one model and retrieval queries with another, every search silently returns noise — and there's no error to catch it.

## Step 3 — Scaffold ingestion (idempotent, re-runnable)

Generate the ingestion path as: **load → clean → chunk → embed → upsert**.

- **Load** the source(s) from `$ARGUMENTS`.
- **Clean** — strip boilerplate, normalize whitespace, drop empty fragments.
- **Chunk** per the Step 2 strategy, carrying source metadata into each chunk.
- **Embed** each chunk in batches with retry/backoff.
- **Upsert** by a stable content-derived ID (e.g. a hash of `source` + chunk index + chunk text) so re-running the pipeline replaces changed chunks and skips unchanged ones instead of duplicating them.

Make it safe to run repeatedly against a partially-populated store — that's the whole point of a content-derived key.

## Step 4 — Scaffold retrieval (grounded, with citations)

Generate the query path as: **embed query → vector search → optional rerank → assemble grounded prompt**.

- Embed the incoming query with the **same** pinned model from Step 2.
- Vector-search for top-k candidates.
- Optionally rerank (cross-encoder or LLM-as-reranker) down to the few chunks that go in the prompt.
- Assemble a prompt that includes the selected chunks **and their source attributions**, instructing the model to answer only from the provided context, cite each claim by source, and say it doesn't know when the context doesn't cover the question.
- Return the answer **with the source list**, so the caller can render citations.

> [!WARNING]
> Never return an ungrounded answer. If retrieval finds nothing relevant, the pipeline must surface "I don't have information on that" — not let the model answer from parametric memory. An unsourced answer in a RAG system is a bug, not a fallback.

## Step 5 — Leave a slot for evaluation

Stub an evaluation entry point next to retrieval — a small harness that takes question/expected-source pairs and reports retrieval hit-rate and answer faithfulness. Leave it empty but wired in, with a comment on what to measure. Don't fabricate eval data; let the user supply it.

## Report

List every file you created and what each one does (ingestion, retrieval, shared config, eval stub). Then give the exact next steps to make it live:

1. Which credentials/env vars to set (embedding + generation API keys, vector-store connection).
2. The command to run ingestion against the real `$ARGUMENTS` source.
3. The single first query to verify retrieval returns grounded, cited results.

End with the one decision most worth revisiting after a first run — almost always the chunking strategy.
