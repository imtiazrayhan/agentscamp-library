description: "Explain what the given code does, in clear prose with a short summary."
argument-hint: "[file or symbol]"
---

Explain the code identified by `$ARGUMENTS`. The argument may be a file path, a function or class name, a module, or a line range. Produce an explanation that a teammate could read once and understand without opening the source themselves.

## Locate the target

Resolve `$ARGUMENTS` before explaining anything.

- If it is a path (e.g. `src/auth/session.ts`), read that file.
- If it is a symbol (e.g. `validateToken` or `class UserStore`), search the codebase to find its definition, then read the surrounding context.
- If it is a path with a range (e.g. `parser.go:40-120`), read those lines plus enough above and below to understand the scope.
- If it is ambiguous or matches multiple results, list the candidates and ask which one is meant. Do not guess.

> [!NOTE]
> Read the actual source before writing a single word of explanation. Never describe code from the name alone.

## Understand before you write

Trace the behavior, not just the syntax. Before drafting, work out:

- The **purpose**: what problem this code solves and who calls it.
- The **inputs**: parameters, arguments, environment, or global state it reads.
- The **outputs**: return values, mutations, writes, network calls, or thrown errors.
- The **control flow**: branches, loops, early returns, and the happy path versus edge cases.
- The **dependencies**: other functions, modules, or services it relies on.
- Any **non-obvious details**: concurrency, caching, side effects, or subtle correctness concerns.

## Output format

Structure the response with these sections.

### Summary

Two or three sentences in plain language stating what the code does and why it exists. A reader should be able to stop here and have the gist.

### How it works

Walk through the logic in execution order. Use prose for the narrative and a short list for distinct steps. Quote only the small, load-bearing fragments that matter — do not paste the whole file back.

```text
1. Receives <input> and validates <condition>.
2. Transforms it via <step>.
3. Returns <output> or raises <error> when <edge case>.
```

### Inputs and outputs

Be precise about types and contracts.

| Aspect | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Inputs | parameters, types, expected shape |
| Returns | return type and meaning |
| Side effects | I/O, mutations, network, logging |
| Errors | what is thrown or returned on failure |

### Edge cases and gotchas

Call out anything surprising: silent failure modes, off-by-one risks, assumptions about input, thread safety, or behavior that contradicts the function name.

## Guidelines

- Match the explanation's depth to the code's complexity. A three-line helper needs a sentence; a state machine needs the full breakdown.
- Use the project's own terminology — variable and domain names as they appear in the source.
- Prefer correctness over completeness. If you are unsure how something behaves, say so explicitly rather than inventing an explanation.

> Do not modify the code. This command only explains. If you spot a bug while reading, mention it in the gotchas section but make no edits.
