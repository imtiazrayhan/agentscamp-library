Rename a code symbol — a function, class, method, variable, type, interface, enum, or constant — everywhere it appears, so the project compiles and behaves exactly as before under the new name. This is a precision refactor: the danger is not finding too few matches, it is changing too many.

## Scope

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` as exactly two tokens: the **old name** then the **new name**.

- `getUserById fetchUserById` → rename `getUserById` to `fetchUserById`.
- If only one token is given, or the two are identical, ask for the missing piece. Do not invent the target name.
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask: *"Which symbol should I rename, and to what?"* and stop.

If the old name is **ambiguous** — it resolves to more than one distinct symbol (e.g. a local `id` in three unrelated functions, or a `Status` type and a `Status` enum) — list the candidates with their file and line and ask which one. Renaming the wrong binding is worse than renaming nothing.

> [!WARNING]
> This is behavior-preserving. Rename only — do not change the symbol's type, signature, value, or call order, and do not "improve" code you pass through. A rename that needs a test assertion changed is a rename that broke something.

## Step 1 — Find and read the definition

Locate where the symbol is **defined**, not just used. The definition tells you its kind (function/class/type/const), its scope (module-level, class member, block-local), and whether it is exported.

```bash
# Anchor on word boundaries so `getUser` does not match `getUserById`
rg -nw "getUserById" --type-add 'src:*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,py,go,rs,java}' -tsrc

# Narrow to likely definition sites
rg -nw "(function|const|let|class|interface|type|enum|def|fn|public|private)\s+getUserById"
```

Read the definition and its immediate surroundings. Establish three facts before editing anything:

1. **Kind** — function, class, type, variable, etc. (affects where else the name can legally appear).
2. **Scope** — is this name unique in the project, or shadowed/reused in other scopes?
3. **Export surface** — is it exported? Re-exported through a barrel/index file? Part of the public API?

## Step 2 — Separate the real symbol from coincidental matches

This is the core of the command and where naive renames fail. A raw text match for the old name will hit three categories — you must keep only the first.

- **The symbol itself** — keep. Same binding, in scope.
- **A different symbol with the same name** — skip. A local `count` in another function, a `Status` from another module. Same characters, unrelated binding.
- **A substring of an unrelated identifier** — skip. `user` inside `username`, `userId`, `getUser`, `superuser`.

> [!WARNING]
> Never run an unanchored find-and-replace. `s/user/account/g` rewrites `username`, `currentUser`, and `userId` and is almost impossible to fully undo. Always match whole words (`rg -w`, `\b…\b`) and, when the name is common, confirm each hit resolves to the binding you read in Step 1 — by scope, import source, or the object/class it hangs off.

For methods and fields accessed via `.`, scope the match to the receiver's type. Renaming a `save` method on `OrderRepo` must not touch `save` on every other object in the codebase. Read the call to confirm the receiver before editing.

## Step 3 — Build the reference list

Sweep for every legitimate occurrence and group it by category so nothing is missed:

```bash
# All whole-word occurrences, with file:line for review
rg -nw "getUserById"

# Imports / exports / barrel re-exports that name it
rg -nw "getUserById" -g '*.{ts,js}' -g '!**/*.test.*' | rg "import|export|require|from"

# Tests, fixtures, and snapshots referencing it
rg -nw "getUserById" -g '*{test,spec}*' -g '*__snapshots__*'

# Docs, comments, and string literals (rename only if the string is the identifier, e.g. a DI token or route name)
rg -nw "getUserById" -g '*.{md,mdx}'
```

Decide string-literal cases deliberately: a DI token, event name, GraphQL field, or serialized key that must stay wire-compatible should usually **not** change even if it spells the old name — changing it is a behavior change, not a rename. Comments and docstrings that describe the symbol **should** change.

## Step 4 — Prefer language tooling, then verify by hand

If the project has language-server rename available, use it — it understands scope and won't touch substrings:

```bash
# TypeScript / JS via ts-morph or the language server's rename
# Rust:    cargo fix is not a rename; use rust-analyzer rename in-editor
# Go:      gopls rename -w 'path/file.go:#offset' 'newName'
# Python:  rope / pyright rename
gopls rename -w "./internal/user/service.go:#1423" "fetchUserById"
```

> [!NOTE]
> Language tooling is the safe default, but it is not the final word. After any automated rename, run the Step 2 grep sweep again for the **old** name — stray hits in comments, generated files, string templates, or tooling-excluded paths are exactly what the language server skips.

If no rename tool fits, apply edits with `Edit` one occurrence at a time from your Step 3 list, never with `replace_all` on a bare word that could appear in other scopes.

## Step 5 — Apply the edits

Edit each occurrence from the reference list. Keep edits surgical: change only the identifier token, leave surrounding whitespace, types, and arguments untouched. Update declaration, every call/reference, imports, exports/barrels, tests, and descriptive comments together so the tree never sits half-renamed.

## Step 6 — Rename the file if it encodes the name

If the symbol's name is baked into a filename — `UserService.ts` for `class UserService`, `use_auth.py` for `use_auth` — rename the file and fix the import paths:

```bash
git mv src/services/UserService.ts src/services/AccountService.ts
# then update every importer
rg -nw "services/UserService"
```

Leave the filename alone if it doesn't track the symbol (e.g. a `utils.ts` that merely contains the function) — renaming it is scope creep.

## Step 7 — Prove nothing broke

The compiler is your strongest oracle that the rename is complete and correct. Run the project's checks and confirm a clean tree:

```bash
# Use whatever the project actually uses
npm run typecheck && npm run build && npm test
# or: tsc --noEmit / cargo check && cargo test / go build ./... && go test ./... / pytest
```

- A "cannot find name `getUserById`" error means a reference was missed — find and fix it.
- A duplicate-identifier or shadowing error means the new name collides with an existing symbol in that scope — stop and report; the new name is unsafe.
- Final sweep: `rg -nw "getUserById"` should return **zero** code hits (intentional wire-compatible string literals aside).

> [!NOTE]
> If a test assertion had to change to pass, the rename altered behavior — most often a serialized key or public-API string you should have left alone. Revert that edit and reclassify it as a string literal to preserve.

## Report

Summarize concisely:

- **Renamed** — `oldName` → `newName`, its kind and where it is defined.
- **Touched** — count and grouping of edits: definition, references, imports/exports, tests, comments, and any renamed file.
- **Skipped** — coincidental substring matches and same-name symbols in other scopes you deliberately left alone, plus any wire-compatible string literals preserved.
- **Verification** — typecheck, build, and tests pass; final grep for the old name is clean.
- **Caveats** — anything ambiguous you resolved by asking, or any public-API/string surface left unchanged on purpose.
