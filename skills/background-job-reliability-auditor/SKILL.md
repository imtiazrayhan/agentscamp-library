Use when a job duplicates work, silently stops, falls behind, fails only at scale, or needs review before production."

Trace asynchronous work from intent to verified outcome.

## Workflow

1. **Define the required outcome.** Identify the user or business effect, acceptable delay, duplication tolerance, loss tolerance, ordering need, and recovery objective.
2. **Map the lifecycle.** Trace producer commit, enqueue, broker delivery, lease or visibility timeout, worker processing, database writes, external effects, acknowledgement, retry, dead-letter handling, and reconciliation.
3. **State delivery assumptions.** Verify what the scheduler or broker actually guarantees under crashes, timeouts, partitions, and redelivery. Do not infer exactly-once effects from product terminology.
4. **Audit idempotency and transactions.** Find the stable operation key, deduplication store, uniqueness boundary, transaction scope, outbox or inbox pattern, and behavior when an external side effect succeeds before local state commits.
5. **Review failure policy.** Check exception classification, backoff, jitter, maximum attempts, retry budget, timeout hierarchy, poison-message isolation, dead-letter ownership, and replay procedure.
6. **Inspect concurrency and lifecycle.** Verify prefetch, worker count, per-key ordering, rate limits, locks, heartbeat or lease extension, graceful shutdown, deploy draining, checkpointing, and resource cleanup.
7. **Assess observability.** Require correlation from request or schedule to job and effect. Measure enqueue rate, completion rate, latency, oldest age, attempts, terminal failures, dead letters, throughput, and saturation.
8. **Exercise recovery.** Define tests for crash before and after side effects, duplicate delivery, broker outage, dependency timeout, malformed payload, deploy interruption, backlog drain, and dead-letter replay.

> [!WARNING]
> A retry policy without idempotency can amplify an outage into duplicate charges, emails, allocations, or data corruption.

## Output

Return a lifecycle diagram in text, verified delivery assumptions, prioritized findings with code or configuration evidence, missing telemetry, failure-injection cases, and a remediation plan. Separate containment from durable fixes.
