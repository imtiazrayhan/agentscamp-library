description: "Design a project's CLAUDE.md and memory hierarchy by exploring the repo to learn its real build/test/lint commands, architecture, and non-obvious gotchas, then writing a concise, skimmable memory that keeps only what belongs in context. Use when onboarding a repo to Claude Code with no CLAUDE.md, or when an existing one is bloated, stale, or being ignored."

CLAUDE.md is loaded into every prompt for the whole session, so it is the highest-leverage and most easily-abused file in the repo: a sharp 40-line memory steers every turn, while a 400-line dump of prose gets skimmed, diluted, and quietly ignored. This skill explores the actual project, decides what earns a permanent slot in context, and writes a memory the model will actually follow.

## When to use this skill

- You're onboarding an existing repo to Claude Code and there is no CLAUDE.md (or `/init` produced a generic one that restates the obvious).
- The current CLAUDE.md is long, stale, or contradicts the code, and Claude keeps running the wrong test command or ignoring a stated rule.
- You want to split repo facts (project CLAUDE.md) from personal cross-project preferences (user `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) and aren't sure what goes where.

## When NOT to use this skill

- You want an automatically enforced rule (format on save, block edits to a path) — that's a hook, not memory; memory is advisory and the model can deviate from it.
- You want a reusable procedure with its own tool scope, invoked on demand — that's a skill, not a fact that must sit in context every turn.

## Instructions

1. **Read the repo before writing a word.** Glob for the build manifest (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `Makefile`) and read its scripts/targets to get the *real* commands — never invent `npm test` if the script is `npm run test:unit`. Grep configs (`tsconfig`, `.eslintrc`, `ruff.toml`, CI workflow YAML) for the lint/typecheck/test invocations CI actually runs; those are the commands that must pass.
2. **Map the architecture in five lines or fewer.** Identify the entry points, the 3–6 directories that matter, and the one data-flow or layering rule that, if violated, breaks the build (e.g. "client components must not import `lib/db`"). Write the *map and the rule*, not a tour of every folder — the model can read the tree itself.
3. **Mine the non-obvious gotchas.** These are the highest-value lines: footguns you can't infer from a glance — a generated file that must be regenerated after content changes, a port that isn't the default, a test that needs a service running, a "looks unused but isn't" module. Surface them from READMEs, CI steps, and conspicuous comments.
4. **Sort every candidate fact into KEEP or CUT.** KEEP: stable conventions, exact commands, the architecture map, hard rules ("never commit to main"), and recurring pitfalls. CUT: transient task state, secrets/tokens, anything derivable by reading the code (function signatures, the full dependency list), and long explanatory prose. If a line only helps once, it doesn't belong in always-on context.
5. **Write it imperative and skimmable.** Short headings, bullet lists, one rule per line in the imperative ("Stage by explicit path", not "It is generally preferable that..."). Put the hardest rules first. Aim for a memory a person can read in under a minute; if it's over ~50 lines, you kept things that should have been cut.
6. **Place facts in the right tier.** Repo-specific facts → project `./CLAUDE.md` (committed, team-shared). Personal habits that apply across all your repos (preferred commit style, "explain before large refactors") → user `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Machine-local, uncommitted notes → `./CLAUDE.local.md`. Never put a personal preference in the shared project file, or a repo command in user memory.
7. **State the freshness contract.** End the draft with a one-line note on what makes it go stale (commands renamed, directories moved) and the expectation that it's updated in the same PR that changes those facts — a wrong command in memory is worse than no command.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not paste the codebase into CLAUDE.md. Memory that duplicates code (full module lists, copied function signatures, exhaustive API surfaces) goes stale silently and burns context on every turn — and stale memory actively misleads, because the model trusts it over the file it didn't read. Keep facts that are stable and expensive to rediscover; let the model read everything else.

> [!CAUTION]
> Never write secrets, API keys, tokens, or internal URLs into CLAUDE.md — it is committed and shipped. If a command needs a secret, reference the env var name, not the value.

> [!TIP]
> Brevity is a feature, not a limitation. When two lines say the same thing, cut one. A memory the model reads fully every time beats a thorough one it learns to skim.

## Output

A ready-to-write `CLAUDE.md` draft tailored to this repo — Project Overview (2–3 lines), exact build/test/lint commands verified against the manifest, a five-line architecture map, hard rules, and known gotchas — plus a short rationale listing what was KEPT vs CUT and why, and a note on which facts (if any) belong in user memory instead. The skill proposes the file via Write; it does not run commands or alter code.
