description: "Measure and attribute LLM token usage and cost across an app — input vs output tokens by feature, route, model, and tenant — then rank the waste and the specific lever to cut it. Use when LLM spend is high or climbing with no clear cause, before scaling a feature that calls a model, or when you need per-feature or per-tenant cost attribution for billing or budgets."

An LLM bill arrives as one number, and that number tells you nothing about what to fix. The waste is almost never spread evenly — a couple of bloated prompts, one feature that streams paragraphs where a sentence would do, or a single noisy tenant usually drive most of the spend. This skill turns the total into an attributed, ranked profile: it instruments every model call to record input vs output tokens, the model, and a feature/route/tenant **tag**, breaks cost down by that tag, and hands you the dominant drivers each paired with the specific lever that cuts it.

## When to use this skill
- The LLM bill is high or rising and nobody can say which feature or tenant is responsible.
- You're about to scale a model-backed feature and want to know its true per-call and aggregate cost first.
- You need per-feature or per-tenant cost attribution for internal budgets, chargeback, or usage-based pricing.
- A verbose feature or a stuffed context window is suspected, but you have no measurement to confirm it.
- A cost regression slipped in — spend jumped after a deploy — and you need to localize it to a call site.

## Instructions
1. **Add the tag before measuring anything — attribution is impossible without it.** At every model call site, capture: model id, input (prompt) tokens, output (completion) tokens, and a stable `tag` identifying the *feature/route* (e.g. `summarize-thread`, `support-reply`) plus `tenant`/`user` where billing matters. Pull token counts from the provider's `usage` object on the response, not a local tokenizer — the provider reflects system prompts, tool schemas, and cache discounts. `grep` the codebase for call sites first (`Grep` for the SDK call, e.g. `messages.create`, `chat.completions`, `generateText`) so no path is missed; a single untagged call site becomes an "unattributed" bucket that hides waste.
2. **Compute cost, don't count tokens.** Map each `(model, input|output)` pair to its price and compute `cost = tokens × price_per_token`, keeping input and output as separate columns. Sum over a representative window (e.g. 7 days, or one full traffic cycle). Tokens alone mislead because input and output, and cheap vs frontier models, have wildly different unit prices.
3. **Break spend down by tag and sort by total cost.** Produce a table: tag × model × {input cost, output cost, calls, avg tokens/call}. Sort descending by total cost. Expect a Pareto shape — the top 2–4 tags usually own the majority of spend. Optimize those; ignore the long tail.
4. **Separate per-call cost from volume — they need different fixes.** For each top tag, look at *both* cost-per-call and call count. An expensive call made rarely and a cheap call made a million times can carry the same total; the first is fixed by trimming the prompt/output, the second by caching, dedup, or not calling at all. Flag which axis dominates each driver.
5. **For each driver, attack the levers in this order (cheapest win first):**
   - **Trim bloated input.** Remove dead boilerplate from system prompts, stop stuffing whole documents/full chat history when a retrieved snippet or rolling summary suffices, and drop unused tool schemas. This is usually the largest, lowest-risk reduction.
   - **Cap or shorten output.** Set `max_tokens` to the real need, ask for terse/structured output, and avoid "explain your reasoning" in production paths where it isn't consumed. Because output is the pricier axis, shaving it often beats prompt trimming on cost.
   - **Downshift the model.** Route easy calls (classification, extraction, short rewrites) to a smaller/cheaper model and reserve the frontier model for genuinely hard ones. Gate the route on a measurable signal, not a guess, and confirm quality holds with an eval set before shipping.
   - **Cache repeated stable prefixes.** Where a long system prompt or document prefix is reused across calls, enable prompt/KV caching so the stable part is billed at the discounted cached rate. Order the prompt so the stable prefix comes first; volatile content last.
6. **Set per-feature budgets and alerts.** Record each top tag's current cost/call and cost/day as a baseline, then add an alert that fires when either exceeds a threshold (e.g. +30%). Treat a token-usage spike like any other regression — caught at deploy, not at the invoice.

> [!WARNING]
> You cannot optimize what you can't attribute. Without per-feature/per-tenant tags, the "profile" is just a grand total — you'll guess which prompt to cut and likely guess wrong. Add the tag and re-collect before doing any optimization work.

> [!NOTE]
> Output tokens usually cost several times more per token than input tokens, so a verbose model response — not a long prompt — is frequently the real cost driver. Always inspect avg *output* tokens/call on your top tags before assuming the prompt is to blame.

## Output
- **Instrumentation/tagging plan** — the list of call sites found, and for each the tag (feature/route + tenant) and the input/output/model fields to record, sourced from the provider `usage` object.
- **Spend breakdown** — a table of tag × model with separate input-cost and output-cost columns (`cost = tokens × price`), calls, and avg tokens/call, sorted by total cost, with an "unattributed" row if any call site is still untagged.
- **Ranked waste** — the dominant drivers in order, each labeled by axis (per-call cost vs volume) and assigned its specific lever (trim context / cap output / downshift model / cache prefix) with the expected reduction.
- **Budgets & alerts** — baseline cost/call and cost/day per top tag plus the threshold alert to add, so future regressions are caught automatically.
