description: "Evaluate a multi-step AI agent's whole run — tool calls, intermediate steps, and final result — not just final-answer correctness, so you can pinpoint WHERE it went wrong. Use when building or debugging a tool-using or multi-step agent, when final-answer-only evals can't explain failures, or when a prompt/model change quietly makes the agent less efficient or more error-prone even though the answer still looks right."

Final-answer evals tell you the agent failed; they don't tell you *where*. An agent that returns the right number might have called the wrong tool first, looped on a flaky API, or stumbled into the answer through a path that collapses on the next input. This skill makes the agent's **process** inspectable: capture the full trajectory — every decision, tool call, argument, and result — then score it on the axes that actually predict failure, asserting what's checkable and judging only what isn't.

## When to use this skill
- You're building or debugging a tool-using / multi-step agent and a final-answer eval says "wrong" without saying why.
- A prompt or model change kept the answers correct but you suspect the agent got slower, looped more, or recovers worse — and you need to prove it.
- You're adding a new tool and want to confirm the agent selects it correctly instead of brute-forcing with the old one.
- Failures are intermittent and you can't tell whether the agent is fragile (lucky path) or robust (sound path).

## Instructions

1. **Capture the full trajectory as a structured, replayable log — one record per step.** Final-answer-only logging is the root cause of un-diagnosable failures. Each step records: the model's decision (the assistant turn, including thinking-block summaries if present), the tool called and its exact arguments, the raw tool result (success/error), and any externalized state (files written, working dir, retry count). Use a stable schema so two runs diff cleanly:
   ```json
   {"run_id": "...", "task_id": "...", "step": 3,
    "decision": "call search_orders to find the open order",
    "tool": "search_orders", "args": {"customer_id": "C-118", "status": "open"},
    "result": {"ok": true, "rows": 2}, "is_error": false,
    "latency_ms": 410, "state": {"retries": 0}}
   ```
   Pull this from your agent loop's tool-call records (or the Managed Agents event stream: `agent.tool_use` / `agent.tool_result` / `agent.custom_tool_use` events carry tool name, input, and result). Persist trajectories to disk so a baseline run is a diffable artifact, not a console scroll-by.

2. **Build a fixed, version-controlled eval set of representative tasks — and deliberately include trap tasks.** A good set has three buckets: (a) routine tasks the agent should handle cleanly, (b) tasks that *require* tool use (the answer isn't in the prompt, so the agent must select and call the right tool), and (c) tasks engineered to trip a known failure mode — a tool that returns an error on the first call (does it recover?), an ambiguous request (does it loop?), a distractor tool that looks relevant but is wrong (does it mis-select?). Pin the set; an eval set that drifts can't catch regressions. Each task carries its expected trajectory assertions (next step).

3. **Score every trajectory on five axes, not one.** Final-answer correctness is necessary but insufficient. For each task, evaluate:
   - **Tool selection** — did it call the right tool for each sub-goal? (mis-selection often produces a right answer via a wrong, slow path)
   - **Argument correctness** — were the tool arguments right? (a `status: "open"` typo'd to `status: "all"` can still return the target row by luck)
   - **Step efficiency** — did it stay within a step budget, or did it repeat calls, loop, or take a needless detour? Measure against a per-task budget, not a global one.
   - **Error recovery** — when a tool returned an error, did the agent recover sensibly (retry once, switch approach) or thrash / give up?
   - **Goal completion** — did it actually finish the task, distinct from "the final text looks plausible"?

4. **Split scoring into programmatic assertions and a narrow LLM-judge — assert everything you can.** An LLM-judge over a whole trajectory is noisy and expensive, and it will rationalize a broken path. So check the deterministic axes with code: exact tool-name assertions, argument equality (or schema match), and step-count budgets are all plain comparisons against the trajectory you captured.
   ```python
   tools = [s["tool"] for s in trajectory]
   assert tools[0] == "search_orders", f"wrong first tool: {tools[0]}"
   assert trajectory[0]["args"]["status"] == "open"
   assert len(trajectory) <= task["step_budget"], f"{len(trajectory)} steps > budget"
   assert not any(s["is_error"] for s in trajectory[-2:]), "ended on an error"
   ```
   Reserve the LLM-judge for the genuinely subjective steps only — "was this reasoning step sound given the prior result?", "was this summary faithful to the tool output?" — and judge **one step at a time** with the step's inputs in context, not the entire run. Default both the agent-under-test and the judge to the latest, most capable Claude model (`claude-opus-4-8`); use a *different* sample or framing for the judge so it isn't grading its own twin, and keep the judge's rubric to one criterion per call.

5. **Diff every candidate trajectory against a stored baseline and report the regressions.** This is what catches the silent ones. After a prompt or model change, re-run the fixed eval set and compare trajectory-for-trajectory against the baseline: tools added/removed/reordered, argument changes, step-count delta, new error-recovery loops, latency delta. A change that keeps the final answer correct but adds two steps, introduces a retry loop, or swaps a precise tool for a brute-force one is a **regression** — surface it even though the answer still passes. Promote a candidate to the new baseline only when the diff is empty or every change is reviewed and intended.

> [!WARNING]
> Grading only the final answer hides process failures. An agent can reach the right answer through a path that is broken, expensive, or lucky — wrong tool, redundant loop, a crash it recovered from by chance — and that path will break on the very next input. The final answer being correct is *not* evidence the agent worked correctly.

> [!WARNING]
> An LLM-judge over a whole trajectory is noisy and tends to rationalize whatever path it sees. Assert the checkable steps — tool names, argument values, step counts — with code, and give the judge exactly one subjective step and one criterion at a time. A judge asked "was this whole run good?" will hand-wave; a judge asked "was *this* summary faithful to *this* tool output?" gives a usable signal.

## Output
- **Trajectory schema** — the per-step record (decision, tool, args, result, is_error, latency, state) and where each field comes from in your agent loop or event stream.
- **Per-axis rubric** — the five axes (tool selection, argument correctness, step efficiency, error recovery, goal completion) with the concrete check for each task.
- **Assertion-vs-judge split** — the deterministic assertions written as code, and the short list of subjective steps routed to a single-criterion LLM-judge (agent and judge both on `claude-opus-4-8`).
- **Baseline-diff regression report** — a per-task diff of the candidate run against the stored baseline (tools reordered/added/removed, arg changes, step-count and latency deltas, new recovery loops), flagging every regression even where the final answer still passes, plus a verdict on whether to promote the candidate to baseline.
