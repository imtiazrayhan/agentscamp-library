description: "Read a slow query's execution plan and turn it into a concrete fix — the exact index to add, the rewrite, or the ANALYZE to run — by getting the REAL plan with EXPLAIN ANALYZE (actual rows + timing, not estimates), finding the offending node, and confirming the fix removes it.

A slow query is almost never slow for the reason you'd guess from reading the SQL. The plan is the ground truth: it shows the database actually chose a Seq Scan over the 40-million-row table, actually fed 500,000 rows into a Nested Loop that estimated 5, actually sorted on disk because no index could supply the order. This skill pulls the **real** plan — `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` with `BUFFERS`, not bare `EXPLAIN` — reads it from the most expensive node outward, names the one node that's costing the time and *why*, and turns that into a specific fix: the index to add (with the right column order), the rewrite that makes the predicate sargable, or the `ANALYZE` that fixes the estimate. Then it re-runs the plan to prove the bad node is gone instead of declaring victory from theory.

## When to use this skill

- One specific query (an endpoint, a report, a dashboard panel) is slow and you need the cause, not a vague "add some indexes."
- A query that was fast got slow after a data-volume change, a deploy, or a schema/index change.
- The planner is doing something surprising — a Seq Scan despite an index existing, or ignoring the index you just added.
- p99 latency on one query is high while the table and load look unremarkable, and you suspect the plan rather than the hardware.
- Before shipping a new query or a `migration-writer` index change, to verify the plan is what you intended.

## Instructions

1. **Get the table shape and existing indexes before touching the plan.** Read the schema for the queried tables: column types, the existing indexes and their column order, row counts (`SELECT reltuples FROM pg_class`, or `\d+`), and whether stats are fresh (`pg_stat_user_tables.last_analyze` / `n_mod_since_analyze`). Grep the codebase for where the query is built so you tune the real SQL (including how parameters bind), not a hand-typed approximation.
2. **Run the REAL plan with actual rows, timing, and I/O — never bare EXPLAIN.** Use `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, FORMAT TEXT)` in Postgres (`ANALYZE FORMAT=TREE` / `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` in MySQL 8+). `ANALYZE` *executes* the query and reports actual rows + per-node `actual time`; `BUFFERS` shows shared/local hits vs. reads (heavy `read=` means I/O, not CPU, is the cost). Run it 2–3 times so a cold-cache first run doesn't masquerade as a planning problem. For a write query, wrap it in a transaction and `ROLLBACK` so `ANALYZE` doesn't mutate data.
3. **Read from the most expensive node outward — find where the time actually is.** In the text plan, `actual time=start..end` is cumulative and inclusive of children; the time a node *adds* is its end-time minus its children's. Find the deepest/innermost node whose `actual time` and `loops × rows` dominate the total. That node — not the top of the plan — is what you fix. Note its `actual rows`, `loops`, and the `Rows Removed by Filter` line.
4. **Check the estimate-vs-actual gap FIRST — a wide gap means stale stats, and that's the real bug.** Compare each node's estimated rows (`rows=`) to `actual rows`. A gap of more than ~10x (e.g. plans for 5 rows, processes 50,000) means the planner is choosing strategy on bad information — usually stale statistics. **Fix this before adding any index:** run `ANALYZE <table>;` (or `ANALYZE` the whole DB) and re-pull the plan. Often the plan corrects itself once estimates are right, and an index you'd have added would have been the wrong one.
5. **Match the symptom to the culprit, then to the fix:**
   - **Seq Scan on a large table with a selective predicate** → the predicate filters to few rows but there's no usable index. Add a b-tree on the filtered column(s). (A Seq Scan returning most of the table is *correct* — don't index it.)
   - **Nested Loop with high `loops` over many outer rows** → the join is iterating per-row when it should batch. The cause is usually a bad row estimate (see step 4) or a missing join-key index; a corrected estimate or an index on the inner join column lets the planner pick a Hash/Merge Join.
   - **Sort (especially `Sort Method: external merge  Disk:`)** → the query sorts at runtime and spills to disk. A b-tree index in the `ORDER BY` order can supply rows pre-sorted, removing the Sort node entirely (and powering `LIMIT` early-exit).
   - **High `Rows Removed by Filter`** → the database fetched far more rows than it kept; the filter ran *after* the scan instead of being pushed into an index. Move the discriminating column into the index so it's a condition, not a post-filter.
   - **Heavy `Buffers: ... read=`** → the working set isn't cached; a smaller/covering index reduces pages touched, or the data genuinely doesn't fit memory.
6. **Check index sargability — an index the predicate can't use is no fix at all.** A b-tree is defeated by a function or cast on the column (`lower(email) = ?`, `date(created_at) = ?`, `col::text = ?`), by a leading-wildcard `LIKE '%x'`, and by an `OR` across different columns. The fix is a matching **expression index** (`CREATE INDEX ... ON t (lower(email))`), a rewrite to a range (`created_at >= d AND created_at < d+1`), or `UNION`-ing the `OR` branches — not a plain index on the raw column.
7. **Order multi-column index columns for the predicate, then the sort.** Put equality-predicate columns first (leftmost), then the range/inequality column, then `ORDER BY` columns — so one index serves both the filter and the ordering. A column used only for a range can't have an equality column usefully placed after it. State the exact `CREATE INDEX` DDL, including `INCLUDE`d columns if a covering index would turn an Index Scan into an Index-Only Scan.
8. **Re-run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` after the fix and confirm the bad node is gone.** Apply the fix (in Postgres, build the index `CONCURRENTLY` to avoid a write lock; `migration-writer` can wrap the DDL). Re-pull the plan and verify the offending node changed type (Seq Scan → Index Scan, Nested Loop → Hash Join, Sort → no Sort) and that total `actual time` dropped. If the planner *ignores* the new index, run `ANALYZE` and re-check sargability before concluding the index is wrong.

> [!WARNING]
> Bare `EXPLAIN` shows the planner's *guess*, not reality — it never runs the query, so it can't reveal a Nested Loop that estimated 5 rows and processed half a million, or which node actually burned the time. Diagnose with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` every time; tuning from estimates is how you add the wrong index.

> [!WARNING]
> A wide estimated-vs-actual row gap (>10x) means stale statistics, and that is the root cause — fix it with `ANALYZE` *before* adding indexes. An index chosen to compensate for a bad estimate is often useless or harmful once the estimate is corrected, and you'll have shipped a write-amplifying index that the planner ignores.

> [!NOTE]
> `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` executes the statement. For `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`, run it inside `BEGIN; ... ROLLBACK;` so diagnosis doesn't change data — and be aware it still fires triggers and acquires locks during the run.

## Output

A short report with three parts:

1. **Annotated plan** — the offending node quoted from the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output, with its `actual rows` vs. estimate, `loops`, `Rows Removed by Filter`, and `Buffers`, plus a one-line statement of *why* it's the bottleneck (Seq Scan / stale-stats row gap / Nested Loop blowup / disk Sort / non-sargable predicate).
2. **The specific fix** — exact `CREATE INDEX ... CONCURRENTLY` DDL with the column order justified, or the SQL rewrite, or the `ANALYZE <table>` command. One concrete action, not a menu.
3. **Before/after proof** — total `actual time` and the changed node type from the re-run plan (e.g. `Seq Scan 1240 ms → Index Scan 3 ms`), confirming the bad node is gone rather than asserting it should be.
