A GraphQL schema is not an afterthought over your endpoints — it's the public contract clients build against, and unlike REST there's no `/v2` to escape a bad decision: the graph evolves in place, forever. Two design mistakes dominate the post-launch pain. First, modeling the schema as a thin RPC wrapper of your existing endpoints (`getUserById`, `listOrdersForUser`) instead of a connected graph of types and relationships, which throws away the one thing GraphQL gives you. Second, sprinkling non-null (`!`) everywhere "to be safe," which is a trap — a single resolver error on a non-null field nulls its *entire parent object*, so a flaky downstream blanks out the whole response. This skill designs the SDL deliberately: types and edges, considered nullability, Relay connections for lists, a consistent mutation payload shape, and an explicit DataLoader plan for the fields that would otherwise N+1.

## When to use this skill

- You're designing a new GraphQL API from scratch and want an SDL that survives years of additive change without versioning.
- You're reviewing or refactoring an existing schema that reads like a list of RPC calls, has `!` on nearly every field, or returns bare arrays for lists.
- You're migrating REST endpoints to GraphQL and need to re-model resources as a connected graph rather than transcribing routes into queries one-for-one.
- Nested queries are slow and you suspect resolvers are firing one DB query per parent row (the N+1 storm).

## Instructions

1. **Model the graph around domain types and their relationships, not your endpoints.** Identify the nouns (`User`, `Order`, `Product`, `Review`) and the *edges* between them, then expose those edges as fields that return types — `User.orders`, `Order.lineItems`, `Review.author` — so a client can traverse `user { orders { lineItems { product { name } } } }` in one round trip. Do **not** transcribe REST routes into a flat field per endpoint (`getUserById`, `getOrdersForUser`, `getProductForLineItem`); that's RPC-over-GraphQL and forces clients back into client-side joins and N round trips. The query-graph shape, not your handler list, is the source of truth.

2. **Set nullability deliberately, field by field — non-null is a contract, not a default.** Mark a field non-null (`name: String!`) only when it *genuinely always resolves* — a column with a NOT NULL constraint, a synthesized value, the object's own `id`. Make a field nullable when a downstream failure (a separate service, a join that can return nothing, a slow API) shouldn't take down the rest of the response. The error-propagation rule is the whole reason this matters: when a non-null field's resolver throws or returns null, GraphQL can't put null there, so it nulls the *nearest nullable ancestor* — often the entire parent object — propagating upward until it hits a nullable field. So `Order.recommendedProducts` (computed by a flaky ML service) must be nullable, or one bad recommendation call blanks the whole order.

3. **Standardize every list as a Relay Connection, not a bare array.** Replace `orders: [Order!]!` with a connection: `orders(first: Int, after: String, last: Int, before: String): OrderConnection!`, where `OrderConnection { edges: [OrderEdge!]!, pageInfo: PageInfo! }`, `OrderEdge { node: Order!, cursor: String! }`, and `PageInfo { hasNextPage: Boolean!, hasPreviousPage: Boolean!, startCursor: String, endCursor: String }`. Cursor-based connections page correctly under inserts/deletes (each page is anchored to a real cursor, not an offset) and give you a uniform place to hang edge metadata later (e.g. `OrderEdge.addedAt`). Bare arrays can't paginate without a breaking change and force `first`/`offset` bolt-ons later. Use connections for any list that can grow unbounded; a small fixed enum-like list (a user's `roles`) can stay a plain array.

4. **Plan for the N+1 problem before you ship — name every field that needs a DataLoader.** Any field that resolves *per parent* — `Order.customer`, `Review.author`, `Product.category` — fires its resolver once per parent row in a list, so `orders(first: 50) { customer { name } }` becomes 1 query for orders plus 50 queries for customers. For each such field, specify a **DataLoader** that batches the per-parent keys into one query (`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ANY($1)`) and caches within the request. Walk the schema and list, explicitly, which fields are 1:1/1:N relationship fetches that must go through a batched loader; a schema with per-parent resolvers and no DataLoader will N+1 itself to death under nested queries.

5. **Evolve by adding fields and deprecating — never repurpose, never version the endpoint.** GraphQL evolves in place: add new fields, types, and optional arguments freely (additive changes are non-breaking because clients select only what they ask for). To retire a field, mark it `@deprecated(reason: "Use fullName instead")` and keep it resolving until usage drops to zero (check field-usage analytics), then remove. Never change an existing field's *meaning* or *type* (`price: Int` cents → `price: Float` dollars is a silent data corruption for every existing client), never tighten nullability from nullable to non-null on a live field, and never add a `/v2` schema — versioning the endpoint defeats the entire evolvability model.

6. **Constrain values with custom scalars and enums; never model a fixed set as a free string.** Use `enum OrderStatus { PENDING PAID SHIPPED CANCELLED }` instead of `status: String` so invalid values are rejected at the query layer and clients get the allowed set from introspection. Define custom scalars for formatted values (`DateTime`, `EmailAddress`, `URL`, `Money`) to centralize parse/serialize/validation and document the format in one place. Reserve `ID` for opaque identifiers (it serializes as a string — don't do math on it).

7. **Give mutations input types and a consistent payload/error shape.** Every mutation takes one `input` argument of a dedicated input type (`createOrder(input: CreateOrderInput!): CreateOrderPayload!`) — input types keep arguments cohesive and let you add optional fields without changing the signature. Return a **payload type**, not the bare entity: `CreateOrderPayload { order: Order, userErrors: [UserError!]! }`, where `userErrors` carries expected, recoverable validation failures (`{ field: ["input","email"], message: "already taken" }`) as *data* the client can render — distinct from unexpected exceptions, which belong in the top-level `errors` array. Keep this `{ entity, userErrors }` shape uniform across every mutation so clients handle errors one way.

> [!WARNING]
> Overusing non-null (`!`) is a trap, not a safety measure. When a non-null field's resolver errors, GraphQL nulls the nearest *nullable* ancestor — so one failing `User.subscription!` field can null the entire `User`, and if `User` is also non-null, it nulls *its* parent, cascading up to potentially blank the whole `data`. Model genuinely-fallible fields (anything backed by a separate service, an external API, or an optional relationship) as **nullable** so a partial failure degrades to one missing field instead of an empty response.

> [!WARNING]
> A schema with per-parent resolver fields and no DataLoader will N+1 itself to death. A query like `posts(first: 100) { author { name } comments(first: 10) { edges { node { id } } } }` fans out into hundreds or thousands of individual DB queries — fast in dev with 3 rows, a query storm in production. Decide the batching plan at design time, not after the first incident: every relationship field gets a request-scoped DataLoader, no exceptions.

> [!NOTE]
> Connections are worth the boilerplate even for lists that "will never be large," because there is no non-breaking path from `[T!]!` to a paginated connection later — clients have already coded against the array. If a list is truly bounded and fixed (status flags, a handful of roles), a plain list is fine; everything user-generated or growth-prone starts as a connection.

## Output

The deliverable is a designed SDL plus the decisions behind it:

- **The SDL** — object types and their relationship fields (edges), `enum`s and custom `scalar`s for constrained values, Relay **connection** types for every unbounded list (`*Connection` / `*Edge` / `PageInfo`), and mutations as `input`-arg + `*Payload` (with `userErrors`) pairs.
- **The nullability decisions** — a short table of the non-obvious fields marked nullable vs non-null, each with its rationale (this field can fail downstream → nullable; this field always resolves → non-null), so reviewers see the error-propagation reasoning.
- **The pagination decisions** — which lists became connections vs stayed plain arrays, and why.
- **The DataLoader / batching plan** — the explicit list of per-parent relationship fields (`Type.field`) that must resolve through a request-scoped batched loader, with the batch key and the batched query for each, so the schema doesn't N+1 under nested queries.
