Replace a legacy module or service the way a strangler fig kills its host tree — by growing new code around the old until the old carries no load and can be cut away. The skill's first and most important move is to find the **interception seam**: the single place where calls can be diverted to either the old or the new implementation. Everything else (slicing, parallel-running, decommissioning) hangs off that seam. Without it, "incremental migration" silently becomes a big-bang rewrite with extra ceremony.

## When to use this skill

- A legacy system is load-bearing and too risky to rewrite all at once — a flag-day cutover would mean a long branch, a scary deploy, and no clean rollback.
- You're migrating off a deprecated framework, library, or service (an ORM, an auth provider, a payments SDK, a monolith you're peeling into services) and want to move capability by capability.
- The legacy code has no tests or unclear behavior, so the only trustworthy spec is "what it currently does" — you need to run new alongside old and compare.
- Stakeholders need the system shippable and reversible the entire time, not dark for months behind a feature branch.

> [!WARNING]
> If you cannot find or build a clean interception seam, stop and reconsider. A migration where callers reach deep into legacy internals — not through one front door — cannot be routed incrementally. You will end up rewriting everything before you can flip anything, which is a big-bang rewrite wearing a strangler-fig costume. Creating the seam (a facade callers go through) is the *first deliverable*, sometimes a whole milestone of its own.

## Instructions

1. **Locate or create the interception seam first.** Find the single chokepoint where calls into the legacy unit can be diverted: a facade/adapter the callers already go through, a network proxy/router (reverse proxy, API gateway, service mesh route), or a feature-flag branch in code. Use `Grep`/`Glob` to map every caller of the legacy unit — if they all funnel through one interface, that's your seam; if they reach in twenty different ways, your first job is to introduce a facade they all route through *before* writing any new implementation. The seam must be able to send a call to old OR new and be flipped at runtime (config/flag), not at deploy time.
2. **Inventory and slice the surface.** List the capabilities behind the seam (endpoints, methods, message types) with, for each, its call volume, blast radius if it breaks, and how self-contained it is (shared state, shared DB tables, downstream side effects). This is your migration backlog. Do not migrate by file or by "module size" — migrate by capability slice, because a slice is what the seam can route independently.
3. **Carve off the smallest valuable slice first.** Pick the slice that is most self-contained and lowest-blast-radius — a read-only endpoint, an idempotent operation, an internal report — not the gnarliest core path. Implement it new behind the seam. The goal of slice one is to prove the *seam and the verification mechanism work end to end*, not to deliver the hardest functionality. Save the high-risk, high-coupling slices for after the machinery is trusted.
4. **Run old and new in parallel and verify equivalence before shifting load.** Before routing real traffic to the new path, run it in **shadow mode**: send the live request to both, return the old result to the caller, and compare the new result off to the side (log/metric the diffs). Define equivalence concretely per slice — exact response match, match modulo known-acceptable differences (ordering, timestamps, formatting), or statistical match on key business metrics when outputs are non-deterministic. Only after the diff rate is at/under an agreed threshold over a representative window do you start serving the new path for real.
5. **Shift traffic gradually and keep rollback one flip away.** Route a small fraction to the new implementation (a percentage, an allowlist of internal users, one tenant), watch error rate / latency / business metrics against the old baseline, and ramp only while they hold. The seam from step 1 makes the rollback trivial: if the new path misbehaves, flip the route back to legacy — no deploy, no revert. Treat every ramp as reversible; never remove the old path while it's still the fallback.
6. **Migrate slice by slice, keeping the system shippable throughout.** Repeat steps 3–5 for the next slice. After each slice fully cuts over, the system is in a valid, releasable state with some capabilities on new and some on old — that is the point. Sequence so that you never half-migrate a slice that shares mutable state with an unmigrated one; if two slices write the same table, plan a shared-data strategy (dual-write with new as follower, or migrate the data owner first) before splitting their routing.
7. **Decommission the legacy only once it is provably dead.** A slice's old code is a candidate for deletion only when: the seam routes 100% to new, the route has been pinned there long enough to cover the full usage cycle (including weekly/monthly/seasonal jobs and rare error paths), and instrumentation shows **zero** hits on the legacy path. Confirm deadness with evidence — access logs, a counter/log line on the old code path showing no calls, `Grep` proving no remaining static references — then remove the old implementation and the now-redundant routing in a final isolated step. Keep the seam until the very last slice is gone.

> [!WARNING]
> Deleting legacy code before confirming it's truly dead causes outages, not cleanup. "We migrated that months ago" is not evidence — a quarterly batch job, an admin tool, or a rare error branch can be the only remaining caller. Require positive proof of zero traffic (a metric/log over a full usage period) plus a static-reference search before any deletion. When in doubt, leave the dead branch behind the seam one more cycle; cold code is cheap, an outage is not.

## Output

1. **Interception seam design** — what the seam is (facade/adapter, proxy/router, or feature flag), where it sits relative to the callers, how it decides old-vs-new (config key / flag / percentage), and how it's flipped and rolled back at runtime. Includes the list of legacy callers found and whether they already route through one door or need a facade introduced first.

2. **Slice-by-slice migration order** — the capability backlog as an ordered table, smallest/safest first, with the rationale for the sequence and any shared-data dependencies that force ordering:

   | Order | Slice (capability) | Volume | Blast radius | Coupling / shared state | Why this position |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | 1 | `GET /report/summary` (read-only) | low | low | none | proves seam + verification end-to-end |
   | 2 | `POST /events` (idempotent write) | high | medium | none | high volume, safe to shadow |
   | 3 | `POST /orders` (core path) | high | high | shares `orders` table w/ #4 | after machinery trusted; pair with #4 |

3. **Parallel-run verification method** — per slice: shadow-mode comparison plan, the concrete equivalence definition (exact / modulo-known-diffs / statistical), the diff threshold and observation window required before serving new, and the metrics watched during ramp (error rate, latency, business KPI vs. legacy baseline) with the ramp schedule (e.g. shadow → 1% → 10% → 50% → 100%).

4. **Decommission criteria** — the exact gate for deleting each slice's legacy code: 100% routed to new, pinned for one full usage cycle, instrumented zero-traffic proof, and a clean static-reference search — plus the final-step plan to remove the old implementation and retire the seam once the last slice is migrated.
