Design the authorization model — the permission system itself — rather than reviewing one that exists. The job is to decide *what capabilities exist*, *how they compose into roles*, *how far each check is scoped*, and *where enforcement lives* — so that application code asks one question, **"can this actor perform this action on this resource?"**, instead of the brittle `if (user.isAdmin)` checks that breed across handlers and rot the moment requirements change. The skill reads the codebase to find the resources, actions, and existing role checks, then produces a concrete permission/role model, a single central enforcement design, and explicit decisions on hierarchy, default-deny, tenant isolation, and audit.

## When to use this skill

- Building authorization for a multi-user or multi-tenant (SaaS) product, where access depends on both *who* the actor is and *which org/project/resource* they are touching.
- When ad-hoc role checks — `if (user.role === 'admin')`, `user.isManager`, `@RequireRole("OWNER")` — are sprawling through controllers and every new rule means a code hunt.
- When "who can do what" is tribal knowledge with no single model, or a customer/security review asks you to document the permission matrix.
- Before adding roles, a permissions UI, custom roles, or an admin-impersonation feature on top of a system that hardcodes role names.

> [!WARNING]
> Scattering role-name checks (`isAdmin`, `role === "manager"`) through the codebase instead of checking granular permissions makes every permission change a risky code hunt and guarantees missed spots — the endpoint you forget is the privilege-escalation bug. Model permissions, compose them into roles, and enforce in one place so a grant change is one edit and coverage is greppable.

## Instructions

1. **Inventory resources and actions before inventing roles.** Glob the routers, controllers, and data models (`**/routes/**`, `**/*controller*`, `**/models/**`, `**/entities/**`) and list every *resource* (invoice, project, user, billing-account) and every *action* on it (read, create, update, delete, approve, export, invite). Permissions are these `resource:action` pairs — `invoice:read`, `invoice:approve`, `member:invite`. Name them after the capability, not the role, so the same permission can be granted to many roles. This list is the vocabulary; everything else composes it.
2. **Compose permissions into roles — never the reverse.** Define roles as *named sets of permissions* (`viewer = {invoice:read, project:read}`, `approver = viewer ∪ {invoice:approve}`). Code checks `can(actor, "invoice:approve", invoice)`, never `actor.role === "approver"`. This is the whole point: when product says "approvers can now export", you edit one role→permission map, not every handler. Grep the codebase for existing `role ===`, `isAdmin`, `hasRole`, `@Role`, `@PreAuthorize` sites and list each as a call site to migrate to a permission check.
3. **Pick the granularity you actually need — and stop there.** Choose explicitly among three:
   - **Pure RBAC** (roles → permissions, global) — fine for single-tenant internal tools where a role means the same thing everywhere.
   - **Scoped RBAC** (role *within* an org/project/workspace) — the default for SaaS: a user is `admin` of org A and `viewer` of org B, and every check is scoped to the resource's tenant. Model the assignment as `(actor, role, scope)`.
   - **ReBAC / ABAC** (permission depends on the specific object's relationship or attributes — "owner of THIS document", "assignee of THIS ticket") — reach for this *only* for the per-object rules; let scoped RBAC carry the rest. Do **not** stand up a full policy engine if scoped RBAC suffices.
   State the choice and the reason; mixing scoped RBAC for the 90% with a handful of ReBAC ownership rules is usually correct.
4. **Centralize enforcement in one authorization layer.** Design a single policy function/middleware — `authorize(actor, action, resource)` (or a guard/policy class) — that every entry point routes through: HTTP handlers, GraphQL resolvers, queue/cron jobs, and admin scripts. No handler should make its own role decision. Specify *where* it sits (e.g. middleware that resolves the resource, computes the actor's permissions in that scope, and allows/denies) so coverage is provable by reading one module, not auditing hundreds.
5. **Default-deny, explicitly.** The policy layer returns deny unless a rule grants. A new route with no policy attached must fail closed (no access), never fall through to allowed. Specify how an un-annotated/un-checked endpoint is detected and rejected (e.g. a route-level assertion that a policy was declared) so "forgot to add a check" becomes a *deny*, not a hole.
6. **Decide role hierarchy and inheritance deliberately.** If `admin` should imply everything `editor` can do, model it as *permission inheritance* (admin's permission set ⊇ editor's) computed when permissions are resolved — not as a chain of `if role >= X` comparisons, which reintroduce role-name logic. Keep the hierarchy shallow and flatten to an effective permission set at check time; document the partial order so "what can role X do" is answerable from the model alone.
7. **Scope every check to the resource — at the API *and* data layer.** A valid role on tenant A must never act on tenant B's data. The permission check answers "may this actor approve invoices?"; the *data* layer must additionally bind the query to the resource's owner/tenant (`WHERE org_id = :actorOrg`, a tenant filter, or row-level security), so changing an id in the URL cannot reach another tenant's row. Specify both: the policy check *and* the scoped query. Skipping the data-layer scope is the classic IDOR — the permission passed, but the object belonged to someone else.
8. **Make it auditable.** Design the model so authorization decisions are explainable and logged: who has which role in which scope (queryable), what permissions a role grants (the map), and a decision log for sensitive actions (actor, action, resource, allow/deny, why). A model nobody can answer "who can approve invoices in org X?" about is not finished.

> [!NOTE]
> RBAC without per-tenant/resource scoping is the most common real failure: a legitimate `admin` of org A passes the `invoice:approve` permission check and then approves org B's invoice because the query fetched by id alone. The permission says *what* the actor may do; the scope says *to which objects*. Both are required — design them together, not as an afterthought.

## Output

A concrete authorization design with four parts:

1. **The permission/role model** — the resource×action permission list, the role→permission map (with inheritance), and the assignment shape (`(actor, role)` for pure RBAC or `(actor, role, scope)` for scoped/multi-tenant).
2. **The central enforcement design** — the single `authorize(actor, action, resource)` entry point, where it sits, what it resolves, and the list of existing scattered role checks to migrate into it.
3. **Granularity decision** — pure RBAC vs scoped RBAC vs ReBAC/ABAC, stated with the reason, including which specific rules (if any) need per-object relationship checks.
4. **The hardening decisions** — default-deny mechanism, role hierarchy/partial order, the API-and-data-layer scoping rule per resource, and the audit/decision-log plan.

```text
Authorization model — scope: src/routes/**, src/models/**  (multi-tenant SaaS)
Granularity: SCOPED RBAC (role within org) + ReBAC for document ownership

PERMISSIONS (resource:action)
  invoice: read, create, update, delete, approve, export
  member:  read, invite, remove
  doc:     read, edit  (edit also gated by ownership — see ReBAC)

ROLES → PERMISSIONS  (within an org)
  viewer   = {invoice:read, member:read, doc:read}
  editor   = viewer ∪ {invoice:create, invoice:update, doc:edit}
  approver = editor ∪ {invoice:approve, invoice:export}
  admin    = approver ∪ {member:invite, member:remove}     # inherits all above

ASSIGNMENT:  (user_id, role, org_id)        # scoped — same user differs per org

ENFORCEMENT (one layer)
  authorize(actor, action, resource):
    1. resolve actor's role in resource.org_id   -> effective permission set
    2. deny if action ∉ permissions              # DEFAULT-DENY
    3. ReBAC rule: doc:edit also requires resource.owner_id == actor.id
  Every route/resolver/job calls authorize(); routes with no policy → fail closed.

MIGRATE these scattered checks into authorize():
  - src/routes/invoices.ts:41   if (user.isAdmin)        -> can(..,"invoice:approve",inv)
  - src/routes/members.ts:88    user.role === "owner"    -> can(..,"member:invite",org)

DATA-LAYER SCOPING (prevents IDOR — required alongside the permission check)
  invoices:  WHERE id = :id AND org_id = :actorOrg     # not findById(id) alone
  docs:      WHERE id = :id AND org_id = :actorOrg      # + ReBAC owner check above

AUDIT
  - role assignments queryable: "who can invoice:approve in org X?"
  - decision log on approve/export/remove: actor, action, resource, allow/deny
```
