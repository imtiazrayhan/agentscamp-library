Audit the HTTP security headers a web app or API actually sends, then harden them without taking the site down. The single highest-value header is a real **Content-Security-Policy** — it is the strongest in-band mitigation for XSS — but it is also the one most likely to break your site if shipped carelessly, so this skill always stages CSP through **Report-Only** first. Around it: enforce HTTPS with HSTS (carefully, because `preload` is effectively one-way), stop MIME sniffing, block framing, tighten `Referrer-Policy` and `Permissions-Policy`, scope CORS so it can't be turned into a credential-leaking open door, and strip headers that advertise your stack and version. Output is a per-header `current → recommended` audit, the exact values to paste, and a rollout plan that goes Report-Only before enforce.

## When to use this skill

- Before a public launch or a major release that changes the frontend, third-party scripts, or the CDN/proxy in front of the app.
- When a scanner (securityheaders.com, Mozilla Observatory, Lighthouse, a pentest report) flags missing or weak headers.
- When standing up a new service, edge config, or reverse proxy and you want headers right from day one.
- After adding a third-party embed, analytics, payment iframe, or auth widget — anything that changes what origins the page must trust.

> [!WARNING]
> Never ship an enforcing `Content-Security-Policy` you have not first run as `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` against real traffic. A directive like `script-src 'self'` will silently kill every inline `<script>`, injected analytics snippet, and third-party widget the moment it enforces — that's a white-screened production site, not a hardened one.

## Instructions

1. **Find where headers are actually set, then observe what ships.** Glob and grep the layers that can emit headers — app middleware (`helmet`, `setHeader`, `res.headers`, `add_header`), framework config (`next.config`, `vercel.json`, `netlify.toml`, `**/middleware*`), and edge config (`nginx.conf`, `*.htaccess`, Cloudflare/CDN rules, `**/*.conf`). Multiple layers may set the same header; the proxy can override the app, or duplicate it. Establish the *effective* response (e.g. `curl -sI https://host` against a deployed instance, or read the proxy config) before changing anything — you can't harden what you can't see, and a header set twice with different values is its own bug.

2. **Set a real Content-Security-Policy — the core control.** Start from a default-deny base: `default-src 'self'`. Then open *only* what the app needs: `script-src` and `style-src` for trusted origins, `img-src`, `connect-src` for your APIs/websockets, `font-src`, `frame-src` for embeds. Avoid `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` in `script-src` — they neuter the whole policy against XSS. For unavoidable inline scripts, use a per-response **nonce** (`script-src 'nonce-<random>'`, regenerated each request) or a **SHA-256 hash** of the script body, not a blanket allow. Always add `object-src 'none'` (kills Flash/plugin vectors) and `base-uri 'self'` (stops `<base>`-tag injection that reroutes relative script URLs). Add a `report-uri`/`report-to` endpoint so violations are collected.

3. **Roll CSP out Report-Only before enforcing.** Deploy the policy as `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` first — same directives, but violations are reported to your collector instead of blocked. Watch the violation stream across representative traffic (all major pages, logged-in and out, the third-party flows) until it goes quiet or shows only known-benign noise (browser extensions inject inline styles — scope by `document-uri`/`blocked-uri`, don't widen the policy for them). Only then flip the header name to `Content-Security-Policy`. Keep `report-to` on after enforcing to catch regressions.

4. **Enforce HTTPS with HSTS — and be deliberate about preload.** Set `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`. Add `; preload` **only** once every subdomain serves valid HTTPS, because preload submission bakes HTTPS-only into shipped browsers and is slow and painful to undo. When first introducing HSTS, consider starting with a shorter `max-age` (e.g. a day) to confirm nothing breaks, then raise it. HSTS only takes effect on a response served over HTTPS, so also ensure a plain-HTTP→HTTPS redirect exists.

5. **Stop MIME sniffing and clickjacking.** Set `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` (stops the browser from re-interpreting a response's type, a classic way to execute an uploaded "image" as script). Block framing with a frame-busting policy: prefer `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self'` (or an explicit allowlist of origins permitted to frame you), which supersedes the legacy `X-Frame-Options: DENY/SAMEORIGIN` — set both for older-browser coverage, but make them agree.

6. **Tighten Referrer-Policy and Permissions-Policy.** Set `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` (sends the full URL same-origin, only the origin cross-origin over HTTPS, nothing on downgrade) — this stops tokens or PII in query strings from leaking via the `Referer` header to third parties. Set `Permissions-Policy` to disable powerful features the app doesn't use, e.g. `camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), payment=()` — an empty allowlist `()` means "no origin, not even self." Only grant features the app actually calls.

7. **Scope CORS tightly — never the wildcard-plus-credentials trap.** If the API serves cross-origin requests, reflect or allowlist **specific** trusted origins for `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`; never reflect an arbitrary `Origin` header back unchecked (that's "allow everyone" with a disguise). The exploitable misconfiguration to hunt for: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` together with `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` — browsers forbid the literal combination, so a server that *needs* credentials will instead reflect the caller's Origin, and if that reflection is unchecked, any site can make authenticated cross-origin requests and read the response. Pin `Allow-Methods`/`Allow-Headers` to what's used, and set `Vary: Origin` when reflecting so caches don't serve one origin's CORS response to another.

8. **Remove headers that leak the stack.** Strip or blank `Server` version detail, `X-Powered-By`, `X-AspNet-Version`, `X-Generator`, and framework banners — they hand attackers a version to match against known CVEs and cost nothing to remove. (`X-XSS-Protection` is deprecated and best set to `0` or omitted; do not rely on it — CSP replaces it.)

9. **Apply the changes, keeping each layer's edit minimal and consistent.** Use Edit to set the recommended values in the right layer (prefer the single source of truth — usually the proxy/edge or one central middleware — over scattering headers across the app). Don't introduce a header in two places with conflicting values. Leave CSP as Report-Only in the committed config if the violation-watch window hasn't completed; note clearly in the rollout plan when to flip it.

> [!NOTE]
> Test against a real response, not the config file. A header in `helmet()` or `next.config` can be silently overridden, dropped, or duplicated by a CDN, load balancer, or framework default. Confirm the effective `curl -sI` output before and after — the wire is the source of truth.

## Output

A per-header audit table (`current → recommended` for every header in scope), the exact header/config values to apply in the identified layer, and a staged rollout plan that puts CSP through Report-Only before enforce. Edits are applied to the header config; CSP stays Report-Only until the violation window is clear.

Rollout plan
1. Deploy all headers above; CSP as Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only with report-to=csp.
2. Watch violation reports across all pages + third-party flows for one full traffic cycle.
3. Resolve real violations (add the specific origin/nonce); ignore extension noise.
4. When the stream is quiet, rename the header to Content-Security-Policy (enforce). Keep report-to on.
5. After every subdomain is verified HTTPS-only, add ;preload to HSTS and submit (one-way).

Fixed now: CORS wildcard+credentials misconfiguration removed; X-Powered-By/Server stripped;
nosniff, frame-ancestors, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, HSTS applied. CSP pending enforce.
