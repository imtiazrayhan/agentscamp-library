Extract structured data from documents and images using a vision-language model, the right way: schema-first, with verification on the fields that matter. VLMs are powerful at reading messy, varied documents that template OCR can't handle — but they can also confidently mis-read an exact value, so this skill pairs extraction with the faithfulness checks that make the output trustworthy.

## When to use this skill

- Pulling structured fields from documents that vary in layout — invoices, receipts, forms, statements, contracts, IDs.
- Scanned, photographed, or handwritten documents where template/positional OCR is brittle.
- You need the result as structured data (a schema) for a database or downstream system, not as free text.

## When NOT to use this skill

- Clean, fixed-format printed text at scale where deterministic OCR is cheaper and sufficient — use traditional OCR.
- General document Q&A or summarization with no structured-output requirement — a plain VLM call is enough.

## Instructions

1. **Define the target schema first.** Specify the exact fields, types, and enums you need, each with a clear description (e.g. `total: number`, `currency: enum`, `line_items: [{description, qty, unit_price}]`). The schema is the contract; design it before prompting. The [llm-output-schema-generator](/skills/api/llm-output-schema-generator) can draft it from a sample.
2. **Pick the model.** Choose an open-weights VLM ([Qwen3-VL](/tools/qwen3-vl)) for self-hosting, privacy, or cost at volume, or a proprietary VLM for maximum capability — decide on measured accuracy for *your* document type, not a benchmark.
3. **Extract with structured output.** Send the page image(s) and prompt the model to fill the schema using the provider's structured-output/JSON mode, so the result conforms instead of being free-form text you parse. See [Structured Output vs JSON Mode vs Function Calling](/guides/concepts/structured-output-2026).
4. **Handle multi-page and large documents.** Split long documents into pages or logical sections, extract per section, and merge — keeping the page reference for each field so values can be traced back.
5. **Verify the fields that matter.** This is the step that makes it production-grade: cross-check critical values (totals, dates, IDs, amounts) against the source — a second pass, a checksum/arithmetic validation (line items sum to the total), or a traditional OCR comparison. A VLM's confident output is not proof.
6. **Confidence and human review.** Capture or estimate per-field confidence and route low-confidence or failed-validation pages to human review rather than silently committing a guess.
7. **Measure accuracy on real documents.** Evaluate field-level accuracy on a representative, labeled sample (including the hard cases — bad scans, edge formats) before trusting the extractor in production, and hand the eval to the [llm-evaluation-engineer](/agents/data-ai/llm-evaluation-engineer).

> [!WARNING]
> VLMs can hallucinate or transpose an exact value while the surrounding text is perfect — a `$1,240.00` read as `$1,420.00`, a digit dropped from an ID. For anything financial, legal, or identity-related, treat extracted values as unverified until checked against the source. The schema guarantees the *shape*, not the *truth*.

> [!NOTE]
> Prefer arithmetic and cross-field validation where the document gives it to you for free — line items should sum to the subtotal, subtotal plus tax to the total, dates should be plausible. These catch mis-reads no confidence score will.

## Output

A working extractor: the target schema, the VLM extraction call with structured output, multi-page handling, the verification/validation step for critical fields, confidence-based routing to human review, and a field-level accuracy measurement on a representative sample — so the structured data is both well-formed and faithful to the source.
